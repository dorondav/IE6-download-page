                    There are many reasons why Windows errors happen, including having malware, spyware, or programs not
                    installing properly. You can have all kinds of system conflicts, registry errors, and Active X
                    errors. Reimage specializes in Windows repair. It scans and diagnoses, then repairs, your damaged PC
